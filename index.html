    <h1>Meet the Salmon Family</h1>
    <p>It all started in 1878 when Hubert L. Salmon baked his first salmon cookie.  At the time, this was a ridiculous idea and he became the laughing stock of his city, forcing him and his family to move over 1,000 miles away and start a new.  Over 140 years later, his great-great-great-great grandson Pat decided to bring back this recipie and modernize it to meet today's tastes.  Pat and his family prepares and slowly bakes each one of these cookies until nice and gooey, then sprinkles the top of the cookie with baked salmon and throws them back into to complete his masterpiece.  Each cookie is made with care and love, and when you bite into it, you can really taste it!  It's a completely life changing experience that everyone should try.
